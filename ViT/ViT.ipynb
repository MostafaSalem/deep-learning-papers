    "Hello there! welcome to the new episode: **Vi**sion **T**ransformer which you might've heard before. I highly recommend you to go through the breakthrough paper [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) which is a foundation of ViT. Alternatively, [Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) is a wonderful resource to get a solid grasp on transformer. After you go over how transformer works, ViT becomes very easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer architecture has swept away **natural language processing** (NLP) field with its brilliant **attention-mechanism** and computational efficiency and scalability. It has become the de-facto standard ever since. However, transformer was not yet fully mature in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation at the time when ViT was published, 2020. As one could imagine, there have been many proposed ways of integrating transformer into vision tasks such as partially replacing convolutional layers or using transformer in conjunction with CNN. Meanwhile, **ViT** suggests **fully transformer-based architecture** for image classification tasks without using CNN (although one CNN layer is used in implementation for efficiency which we'll talk about shortly)."

    "Let's briefly review attention mechanism. The core idea of attention mechanism is that each **word** would have some sort of **relations** with other words in a sentence. For example, in the sentence \"**Jason** didn't go to school because **he** was too tired\", the word \"**he**\" cannot be entirely interpreted without \"**attending**\" to the word \"Jason\". This is obviously true as we know the word \"he\" is a pronoun referring to the name \"Jason\". Also, \"tired\" is more related or more \"attends\" to \"he\" or \"Jason\" and \"school\". This is why we use **attention mechanism**: to untangle the **attention** of a word to other words in a sentence.\n",

    "\n",
    "Great job! We've dived deep into how ViT works. However, here comes a very important concept, **inductive bias**, to further understand ViT. You might've heard that ViT requires **extensive data** to have a good performance. When trained on mid-sized datasets such as ImageNet without strong regularization, ViT yields accuracy **worse than CNN models**. Why does this happen? The most plausible reason is that the **transformers lack some of the inductibe biases inherent to CNNs** such as **translation invariance** and **locality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inductive bias is **any belief or assumption we have about the unseen data**. Let's take an example. Suppose we want to predict a housing price based on house size, number of floors, and number of bedrooms. One possible way of modeling architecture is to have a complex model with 30 billion parameters. On the other hand, **we can utilize our humans' common sense** that those three criteria are somehow **linearly correlated** to the house price. This is exactly what the inductive bias is about. We made an assumption that **house price is linearly correlated** to those criteria. Then, we can more effectively design and train our model for this specific \"house price prediction\" task without consuming heavy computational resources. The first model with tons of parameters would require **extensive dataset** to figure out the \"linear relationship\" since it literally starts training **from scratch**.\n",

    "## Relational Inductive Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational inductive bias is a type of inductive bias. Relational inductive bias representes the **relationships between entities in the network**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional neural network, CNN, uses **kernels** or **filters** which capture **local relationships** between the **entities** in the kernel. Hence, CNN has **locality** relational inductive bias. Also, the entities(pixels) in CNN are locally grouped so CNN has **weak global relationships** while the plain FCN densely connects the entities. Consequently, CNN is good at capturing **features** of an image which is suitable for image classification. With this characteristic, CNN has **translation invariance** relational inductive bias which means translation of a cat in an image is still classified as a cat. Also, CNN has **translation equivariance** relational inductive bias since if you feed input with different positions, the output feature map will be focusing on the specific position of the objects. This translational equivariance property is converted into translation invariance by the last layers for classification. Lastly, CNN has **2D neighborhood structure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **transformer** architecture has a **weak image-specific inductive bias**. In ViT, only **MLP** are **local** and **translation equivariance** while the **self-attention is global**. The two-dimensional neighborhood structure is only used in the beginning where the image is cut into **patches** and at fine-tuning time for adjusting the **position embeddings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this weak inductive bias, transformer needs **extensive dataset** since it has to learn about the 2D positions of patches and all spatial relations between the patches **from scratch**. Although ViT shows suboptimal performances with small or mid-sized (worse than CNN), it outperforms CNN-based models with large dataset."
