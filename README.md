# ðŸ”¥ Research Papers Review & Implementation

Hello! 

This is a repository for **deep learning research papers review and pytorch implementation**. Various subjects including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, backbones, augmetnations are covered.

My goal is to provide **thorough guide as well as intuitive implementation** as I often have hard time searching through the internet for details.

If you want to see other materials, check out my blog.

# ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each paper is assigned to each folder.

- `paper_name/`
    - `paper_name.ipynb`: In each folder, there's a `.ipynb` file which is a complete **paper review**.
    - `code/`: In each folder, there's a sub-folder named `code/` which stores **pytorch implementation** of the paper.
    
Some of the papers may not have `.ipynb` or `code/` but I'm working on providing the full resources as soon as possible.

Any feedbacks are always welcome!
