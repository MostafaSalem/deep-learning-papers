    "Semantic segmentation is a task to assign **each pixel** to a desired class label. It's widely used in fields such as augmented reality devices, autonomous driving, and video surveillance. Two crucial requirements for semantic segmentation task are **rich spatial information** and **sizeable receptive field**. Different from some other computer vision tasks including object detection and image classification, semantic segmentation requires **very dense** prediction for each pixel. Hence, the network architecture must be capable of delivering **rich spatial details** of the original input image. At the same time, the model must also have **enough receptive field** to capture the context of the image for accurate predictions. However, modern (as of 2018) approaches compromise sptial resolution for real-time inference speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been mainly three approaches to boost up the model in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Restricting the input size** to reduce the computation complexity by cropping the input image. This approach, however, inherently limits the useful spatial details of the input image which leads to suboptimal performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Pruning the network channels** to boost up the inference speed, especially in the early stages of the model. However, this approach weakens the spatial capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dropping the last stage of the model** to achive an extremely tight framework. However, this approach has a not enough receptive field to covert large objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these weaknesses, a novel **U-shape** architecture was proposed which gradually increases the spatial resolution, fusing with the hierarchical features of the backbone network. However, this architecture has **two drawbacks**. First, the complete U-shape architecture reduces the model's speed due to high-resolution feature maps. Secondly, most spatial information lost in the pruning or cropping cannot be easily recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet), 2018** was proposed to challenge this dilemma with simple yet effective methods which we will cover in much detail soon."

    "A few approaches have been proposed to **preserve the resolution** of the inpute image while some other approaches have been suggested to capture **sufficient receptive field** such as pyramid pooling, atrous spatial pyramid pooling or, simply large kernel. However, it's hard to meet the both demands simultaneously. Especially for **real-time semantic segmentation**, many approaches utilize **small input size** or **lightweight base model** to boost up the speed. However, a small input size loses much spatial details of the original image while the lightweight model damages the spatial information with the channel pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively preserve spatial information, **BiSeNet** proposes **Spatial Path** which enables the model to encode affluent spatial information. This module is very simple. It includes **three convolution blocks** consisting of one convolution layer (stride=2), batch normalization, and ReLU. Finally, Spatial Path downsamples the original image by `1/8` which still contains rich spatial information.\n",

    "The Spatial Path preserves enough spatial information. Remember that we still need to deal with the **receptive field**. The **Context Path** module of BiSeNet was devised to meet this requirement. The Context Path utilizes **lightweight model** and **global average pooling** to provide large receptive field. Pre-trained Lightweight models such as **Xception**, **ResNet18** and **ResNet101** (bit heavy) were used which quickly downsample the feature map which encodes high-level semantic context information. We also combined the output of the global average pooling, called \"tail\", with the features of the lightweight model. The details could be found in the above figure.\n",
