    "\n",
    "The AlexNet won the first place in ILSVRC-2012$($ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge$)$ with 15.3% top-5 test error rate by a considerable margin of 26.2% compared to the second-best model. The AlexNet sparked attention to the effectiveness of **CNN**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The author suggests that object recognition task is extremely complex$($ex. how many different photos of a dog possible? infinite$)$ which cannot even be all addressed by a large dataset such as ImageNet. Therefore, a more robust model that gives strong and correct insights about nature is needed: CNN. For example, the kernels$($filters$)$ in CNN have much smaller size than the entire image dimension and slide through the image with a certain stride. This corresponds to the locality of pixel dependencies of nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageNet dataset consists of over **15 million** labeled images with about **22,000** categories which is HUGE. The usual ImageNet that you've seen is only a subset with 1000 classes. To maintain a consistent input dimensionality, they're downsampled to **256 x 256**.\n",

    "AlexNet has **5 Conv layers** and **3 FC layers** with **ReLU** nonlinearity and **Local Response Normalization(LRN)** which we will see shortly. Also, as we will see in short, data augmentations are performed and the input image dimension is `3x227x227` $($The paper says 224x224 but this will lead to wrong dimensions after going through the network$)$. See [CS231n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAOcjicFr1Y&list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk&index=9).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReLU nonlinearity comes right after every conv and FC layer. The author adopted **overlapping pooling** where the `kernel size > stride`. It was observed that the overlapping pooling made the model slightly more difficult to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason each layer has two blocks is due to multi-GPU training. Also, it's funny that the top-portion of the image is cut-off. I assume this is due to the page limit of the journal.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditionally, `sigmoid` $f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ and `tanh` $f(x)=\\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}}$ activation functions were frequently used. However, they have significant disadvantages. If the input values of those functions are too big or small, then the neurons will be saturated $(ex. sigmoid(5) \\approx 0.9933)$. Consequently, gradient vanishing could happen. Think about $g'(x) = g(x)(1-g(x))$ for sigmoid and $g'(x)=1-g(x)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The author adopted **ReLU**: $f(x)=max(0,x)$. It was observed that DNN with ReLUs train several times faster than with tanh. Below is the graph comparing training error rate of ReLU$($solid line$)$ and tanh$($dashed line$)$. As you can see, a 4-layer CNN with ReLUs reach 0.25 error rate approximately **6 times** faster than tanh.\n",
    "\n",
    "ReLU function does not saturate in the positive region and it's also computationally very efficient. Moreover, it's actually more biologically plausible than sigmoid and tanh. I'm not an expert in biology, but I guess instead of actually always neurons, it will have to reach some critical point to get activated.\n",

    "The LRN acts like a **lateral inhibition** in real neurons which compete for big activities amongst neuron outputs computed using different kernels $($referenced from paper$)$.

    "A overfitting-preventing method that is still widely used today is **data augmentation**. You crop, flip, scale, modify brightness, and so on to give dynamic versatility to the data distribution so that it will better generalize for unseen images. The author in the paper used **horizontal flip** and **random cropping**.\n",
    "\n",
    "During test time, the network extracts 5 cropped images and their horizontal reflections. Then, the network averages the predictions from 10 image patches and give the final prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method adopted to prevent overfitting is dropout. What it does is that the network randomly **drops** certain number of neurons with the probability of **0.5**. The effects of dropout is quite interesting. The following are advantages and philosophical intutions behind dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It prevents co-adaption of features\n",
    "   - Since you never know if your close buddies will be removed in next round, you'd hone yourself rather than relying too much on your friend.\n",
    "2. it performs model-ensembling\n",
    "   - If you count the combinations of different models from each dropout, it's A LOT. Probability more than the number of stars in the universe. Each time you perform dropout, you will technically get a different model. Therefore, the final weights are combinations of those different models, in effect.\n",
