    "> ## ResNet\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet was a breakthrough idea that swept ILSVRC 2015 classication, ImageNet detection, localization and COCO detection as well as segmentation competition. Then what was special about ResNet?\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### What was ResNet trying to address?\n",
    "\n",
    "Extremely deep neural networks suffer from training error. But the really weird thing is it doesn't suffer only from the test set, but also from **training set**. Wait..this is quite counterintuitive. In fact, adding more and more layers lead to even higher training error. It's no more an **overfitting** problem. The author of the paper conjectured that it's harder to **optimize** extremely deep neural networks. The ultimate goal of ResNet is to address this very counterintuitive **degradation** problem.\n",

    "2. Enjoy extra accuracy by deeper and deeper model\n",

    "> ## Deep Residual Learning Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of ResNet is to fit a **residual mapping** rather than to fit the original desired underlying mapping. Let me elaborate.\n",

    "Let $H(x)$ be the **desired underlying mapping**, then instead of trying to fit $H(x)$ directly, we try to fit $F(x):=H(x)-x$ where x is the **identity mapping**. The author hypothesized that it's easier to optimize the residual mapping than the original mapping. In the worst case scenario, if, in fact, the identity mapping were optimal, then it would be much easier to **push the residual to 0**(push $F(x)$ to 0) than to **fit an identity mapping** by learning a stack of nonlinear layers. To achieve this mapping, **shortcut connection** is introduced which is simpling \"copying\" $x$ and add to $F(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Intuition for shortcut connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Why might this \"shortcut connection\" be helpful? The intuition is that if the \"plain\" nonlinear layers can asymptotically approximate the underlying function $H(x)$, then it's equally like that it can fit the residual function $F(x):=H(x)-x$. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, if the identity mapping were indeed optimal, then the netowrk could push the residual to 0 to recover the identity mapping. In other words, the residual mapping must perform **AT LEAST** as good as the plain nonlinear layers. In the worst case scenario where all the residual mappings were actually useless, which is very unlikely to happen, the ResNet will at least do **no harm** to the plain nonlinear layer counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Identity mapping by shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet adopts residual learning to **every few stacked layers** which you can think of as **building block**. The building block is formally defined as\n",
    "\\[[ y=F(x,\\{W_i\\})+x \\]]\n",
    "Where $x$ and $y$ denote input and output of the building block and $F(x,W_i)$ denotes the residual mapping. For example, in **two layer block**, the representation would be $F=W_2\\sigma(W_1x)$ where $\\sigma$ is **ReLU** nonlinearity(biases are omitted). The shortcut connection $F+x$ is done by element-wise addition. The last nonlinearity is applied **after** this shortcut connection ($i.e., \\sigma(y)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of this shorcut connection is that it introduces neither **extra parameters** nor **computational complexity** as it's a trivial element-wise addition. Note that to perform the element-wise addition, the dimensions of $F$ and $x$ must be equal. However, if this is not the case, the dimensions could be matched by two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The shortcut is applied with **zero-padding** to increase dimension(no extra parameter)\n",
    "2. The **linear projection** **$W_s$** (1x1 conv) is performed by the shortcut connection: $$ y=F(x,W_i)+W_sx $$\n",

    "For explicit comparision, the experiment was performed for **plain network** and **residual network** with exact same number of parameters(of course, except the shortcuts). The left graph in the figure shows that the plain 34-layer network shows higher validation error than the shallower 18-layer(degradation). However, the equivalent counterpart, ResNet-34 indeed outperforms ResNet-18. The result expliclty hits that the residual mapping indeed seems to address the degradation problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "> ## Bottleneck Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that ResNet-50 and above have two **1x1 conv** filters in the building block. To achieve affordable computational efficiency, the building block is modified as a **bottleneck** design. Instead of feeding the huge complexity to the 3x3 conv layer, 1x1 conv layers **reduce** and then **increase(restoring)** the dimension, taking burdens away from 3x3 layer. Indeed, the 50/101/152-layer ResNets are recorded more accurate than the shallower Resnet by considerable margins with no degradation problem. The model also has great generalization performance where it could be applied to object detection and segmentation problems.\n",
