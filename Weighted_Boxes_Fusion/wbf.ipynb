    "When real-time inference is not required, ensembling different models can bring about performance boost. Some of popula ensembling methods for object detection include **non-maximum suppression** which simply removes \"duplicated\" bounding boxes whose IoU with a selected bounding box is greater than the given IoU threshold. Another recent method is **Soft NMS** which reduces the confidences of proposals propotional to IoU values. However, these methods **cull out** some bounding boxes based on certain criteria but do not utilize all the bounding boxes. Thus, some bounding boxes that might **potentially contribute** to the good performance are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, a new ensembling method, **weighted boxes fusion (WBF)**, is introduced which **utilizes all proposed bounding boxes to construct the averaged boxes**. The weighted boxes fusion is quite simple and straightforward yet brings about a large performance boost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the implementation in this post my own implementation which is intended to be easier and more intuitive to understand. That means it does not aim for efficiency. Once you understand how the WBF algorithm works, you can jump to the official implementation by the original author which I provided in the later section."

    "So far, the non-maximum suppression is probably the most-known ensembling method. In NMS, first sort all the bounding boxes with respect to confidence score. Starting from the highest confidence score bounding box (Box A), all the bounding boxes whose IoU with the Box A are greater than the pre-defined IoU threshold are **removed**, leaving out only the \"best\" bounding box for a specific target object. However, setting this threshold is tricky: If there're objects of same class **side by side**, then only one will be remained which is not something we want."
