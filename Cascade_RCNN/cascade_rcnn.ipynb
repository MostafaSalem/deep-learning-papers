    "1. **Overfitting** happens during training since the number of positive examples exponentially vanishes if trained with a high IoU threshold (more picky towards the bbox quality)\n",

The Cascade R-CNN consists of a **sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, to be sequentially more selective against close false positives**. The detectors are trained **stage by stage**, leveraging the observation that the **output of a detector is a good distribution for training the next higher quality detector**. In other words, suppose a detector is trained with `0.5 IoU` threshold, then the output of this will be fed into the next stage detector trained with `IoU 0.6` (only 0.1 difference), narrowing the distribution gap between the consecutive stages.\n",

    "> # Background & Cascade R-CNN Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Object detection is a complex problem, mainly dealing with **recognition** and **localization** problem. Both tasks are particularly difficult because the detector faces **close but not correct** bounding boxes (false positives). Therefore, the detector must find the true positives while suppressing the close false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, a detector trained with a low IoU thershold (typically `0.5`) establishes a loose requirement for positives, producing rich and diversified but noisy bounding boxes. But a high IoU threshold brings about overfitting problem. How can we deal with this trade-off?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving in, let's look at some important terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **quality of an hypothesis** is defined as its **IoU with the ground truth**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **quality of a detector** is defined as the **IoU threshold** $u$ used to train it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of this paper is that **a single detector can only be optimal for a single quality level**. Therefore, the goal is to optimize **for a given IoU threshold** rather than false positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is visualized in the below figure that shows performances of three detectors trained with different IoU thresholds (`0.5`, `0.6`, `0.7`)\n",

    "## Localization Performance\n",
    "The localization performance is evaluated as a function of the **IoU of the input proposals**. In other words, it's a graph of **quality** of output bounding boxes with respect to the proposals by, for example, Region Proposal Network (RPN). Each bounding box regressor performs best for examples of **IoU close to the threshold that the detector was trained**. For example, if you look at the blue line ($u$=0.5), it seems that the **vertical gap** between the blue line and the gray line decreases as the input IoU increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detection Performance\n",
    "The phenomenon also holds for detection performance which evaluated as a function of **IoU threshold**. If you look at the detector of `u=0.5`, it outperforms the detector of `u=0.6` for low IoU levels but underforms at higher IoU levels. In other words, if your detection competition's criteria is for `u=0.5` (low IoU threshold), then the detector of `u=0.5` performs better than the the detector of `u=0.7` but if the criteria is for `u=0.9`, then the detector of `u=0.5` performs worse than that of `u=0.7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "We can learn some insights from these observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A detector optimized at a single IoU level is **not necessarily optimal** at other levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Higher quality detection requires a **close match** between the detector and the hypotheses that it processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A detector can only have high quality if presented with **high quality proposals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, just increasing `u` during training does not resolve the problem. The problem is that the distribution of hypotheses out of a proposal detector is **heavily imbalanced towards low quality**. So if you increase `u`, then it will wipe out all those low quality proposals, leaving out only a few positive training samples which inevitably leads to overitting problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there's a mismatch between the quality of the detector and that of the testing hypotheses at inference. High quality detectors are only necessarily optimal for **high quality hypotheses**. The performance can degrade if they're asked to work on the hypotheses of other quality levels. For example, the proposals from the RPN are usually not of high quality but rough \"guideline\" proposals. But if the detector is asked to make really high quality proposals when the proposals it got are garbages (a bit extreme), there comes a quality gap between the two stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. This is like you're trying to win a battle with bad weapons."
